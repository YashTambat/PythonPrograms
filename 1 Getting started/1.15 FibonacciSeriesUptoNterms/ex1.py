'''

Example
Input : 4
Output : 0 1 1 2

The series Looks like : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 â€¦

Its a unique sequence where the next number is the sum of previous two numbers.

Where the first two terms are always 0 and 1
In mathematical terms :
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

Where,
F0 : 0
F1 : 1
